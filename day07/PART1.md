# Day 7: Laboratories

Analyze a tachyon manifold to count beam splits.

## Mechanics

A tachyon beam enters at location `S` and moves **downward**. It interacts with the grid:

- **Empty space (`.`)**: Beam passes through
- **Splitter (`^`)**: Beam stops; two new beams created (one left, one right)

## Important Rule

When two beams reach the same splitter simultaneously, they don't create additional beams beyond the normal split.

## Example

```
........S.......
................
......^.........
................
....^...^.......
................
..^.......^.....
................
^.....^.....^...
................
................
................
................
................
................
................
```

The beam enters from `S` and propagates downward, splitting at each `^` encountered.

**Example result:** 21 splits

## Task

Count the **total number of times the beam is split** as it propagates through your manifold diagram.
